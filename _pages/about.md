I am a postdoc at the [AABL Lab](https://aabl.cs.tufts.edu/) at Tufts University in Medford, MA. My work focuses on assistive robotics, specifically on building robots that people can use and subordinating autonomy to overall human-robot capability.

I earned a Ph. D. at the [Robotics Institute](http://ri.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I worked at the [HARP Lab](http://harp.ri.cmu.edu) with [Henny Admoni](http://hennyadmoni.com), studying how to build robot manipulators and manipulation autonomy for assistive technologies and particularly focusing on how to incorporate nonverbal behavior, such as eyegaze, into these systems.

Previously, I worked at the [Naval Research Lab](https://www.nrl.navy.mil/) in DC as a support mechanical (and software) engineer, where I helped to build systems for radar and autonomy research.

I graduated from [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) in 2012 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Ancient-Medieval Studies.
